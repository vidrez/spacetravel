# Spacetravel 🌌

Spacetravel is a 3D solar system "simulation" built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). Started as a university side task quite some years ago when first approaching Javascript, a project without many pretensions and with questionable code, but it works and it's cool.

## Features

- 🌍 Realistic 3D models of the Sun, planets, and moons.
- 🌌 Orbital paths and accurate scaling of celestial bodies.
- 🖱️ Interactive controls to navigate and zoom.

## Demo

Check out the live demo here: [Spacetravel Simulation](https://spacetravel.vidrez.me/)
